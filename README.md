My Portfolio Website
====================

This repository includes the code for my portfolio site, made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. This project involved me experimenting with combinations of colour, typography, and shapes with the goal of creating a site that is aesthetically pleasing and unified, and I expanded my skillset by learning how to create additional functionality, including an animated loading screen and a 'back to top' button that only appears after the user has scrolled a certain distance, and different effects in CSS by adding overlays onto images and changing properties of Bootstrap containers and horizontal rules.
